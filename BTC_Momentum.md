# Bitcoin Bull Market momentum

## Problem Statement

In the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading, capturing significant price movements during a bull market can lead to substantial profits. However, the challenge lies in developing a strategy that can effectively identify and act on these movements while managing risk. This project aims to address this problem by creating an automated trading bot that leverages technical analysis to capture big movements in a Bitcoin bull market.

## Approach

To tackle this problem, we will use a combination of technical indicators and a well-defined trading strategy. The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data for Bitcoin from the KuCoin exchange.
2. **Indicator Calculation**: Calculate key technical indicators such as Average True Range (ATR), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and custom signals to identify potential entry and exit points.
3. **Signal Generation**: Develop a strategy to generate buy and sell signals based on the calculated indicators.
4. **Risk Management**: Implement stop-loss and trailing stop-loss mechanisms to manage risk and protect profits.
5. **Backtesting**: Test the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance and make necessary adjustments.
6. **Execution**: Deploy the trading bot to execute trades in real-time based on the generated signals.

## Strategy Rules

- **Determine Upward Trend**: Identify an upward trend by checking if the closing price is above a moving average (e.g., EMA).
- **Check for Bearish Volatility**: Ensure there is no bearish volatility by analyzing the ATR indicators.
- **Entry Signal**: Generate an entry signal if there is an upward trend and no bearish volatility.
- **Exit Signal**: Implement a trailing stop-loss to generate an exit signal and protect profits.
- **Tight Trailing Stop**: Apply a tight trailing stop when in trade and bearish volatility is detected.

*Inspiration for this strategy was drawn from "Zen and the Art of Trading".*




### Data Collection

We directly fetch historical price data from the KuCoin exchange using their API. This data is then transformed and stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

### Indicator Calculation

We calculate various technical indicators using the `pandas_ta` library. Key indicators include:

- **ATR (Average True Range)**: Measures market volatility and helps in setting stop-loss levels.
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Identifies the trend direction and potential entry points.
- **Custom Signals**: Developed based on specific criteria to capture big movements.

### Signal Generation

The strategy generates buy and sell signals based on the calculated indicators. For example, a buy signal might be generated when the price crosses above the EMA, and a sell signal might be generated when the price crosses below the EMA or hits the trailing stop-loss.

### Risk Management

To manage risk, we implement stop-loss and trailing stop-loss mechanisms. The stop-loss is set based on the ATR to account for market volatility, while the trailing stop-loss adjusts dynamically to lock in profits as the price moves in our favor. Additionally, a tight trailing stop is applied when in trade and bearish volatility is detected to protect against sudden downturns.

### Backtesting

We backtest the strategy using historical data to evaluate its performance. This involves running the strategy on past data and analyzing the results to identify any weaknesses or areas for improvement.

### Execution

Finally, we deploy the trading bot to execute trades in real-time. The bot continuously monitors the market, calculates indicators, generates signals, and executes trades based on the predefined strategy.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
2. **Configure API Keys**: Update the API keys in the configuration file for KuCoin exchange access.
3. **Run the Bot**: Execute the main script to start the trading bot.
